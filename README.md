# JAX vs TensorFlow vs PyTorch: Deep Learning Framework Comparison ðŸ¥Š

This repository contains a performance comparison between JAX, TensorFlow and PyTorch using a neural network classifier on the wine dataset.

## Overview

The Jupyter notebook compares:
- Implementation complexity
- Training time performance
- Model accuracy
- Framework features and ecosystem

## Key Results

- JAX achieves same accuracy as TensorFlow with 10x faster training
- All frameworks reach similar accuracy levels
- JAX requires Stax for easier model building
- Clean comparison using wine dataset from scikit-learn

## Requirements

```python
jax==0.4.13
tensorflow==2.13.0
torch==2.0.1
numpy==1.24.3
pandas==2.0.3
matplotlib==3.7.2
scikit-learn==1.3.0
seaborn==0.12.2
```
